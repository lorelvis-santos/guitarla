# 🎸 GuitarLA - React Project

This project is part of the **React & TypeScript – La Guía Completa** course by **Juan de la Torre (Udemy)**.  
It’s a single-page React application that simulates an online guitar store. The goal of this project is to practice **state management**, **component structure**, and **performance optimization** using core React hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useMemo`.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Dynamic product rendering:** Displays a list of guitars loaded from a data file.
- **Shopping cart system:** Allows users to add guitars to the cart with quantity and price tracking.
- **Cart management:** Users can increase, decrease, or remove items directly from the cart.
- **Live total calculation:** The cart’s total updates automatically based on the selected items.
- **Optimized performance:** Uses `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary recalculations.
- **Component-based UI:** Built entirely with modular React components.
- **Bootstrap styling:** The layout and styling are based on pre-provided HTML and Bootstrap CSS from the course.
